# Playwright’s clock API example

This repo demonstrates how you can use Playwright’s clock API to fast forward in time and speed up your test execution. 

See a full tutorial on my [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/VR0KI-sGmMM).

To run this repo:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`

To create recordings of your test with Replay, you need to generate an API key. Follow the [instructions in docs here](https://replay.help/6YdjUFO) and then run `npm run test:replay`

Happy testing!
